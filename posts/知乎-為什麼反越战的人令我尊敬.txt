为什么反越战的人令我尊敬，支持希拉里的所谓“白左”却令我厌恶？

唉，又要重复： 美国白左 表面上同情黑人，可是在国外的战争中残杀 穆斯林。 这叫自相矛盾，也就是虚假。 虚假自然惹人讨厌。

为什么这不是人人皆知的呢？ 因为美国主流媒体 很自然地希望掩盖这个矛盾。

那为什么在中国也讲不清楚呢？ 因为大多数左派的人其实不懂政治，他们只是幼稚地觉得得不到的东西就要抢。 他们只关心和较富的人攀比，而不是真的关心所谓「弱势社群」。  所以穆斯林被杀戮他们也不同情。其实中国人也是极度种族歧视的，甚至比白人更甚。 

你或许会问： 中国人也种族歧视，岂不是很蠢？

是。


*sigh*  I have to repeat this again.  On the surface, American liberals sympathize with black people, but they kill Muslims in foreign wars.  This is self-contradictory and is called hypocrisy.  Of course it disgusts people.

Now why isn't this common knowledge?  That's because the American mainstream media tries to cover it up, naturally.

But why is this also unclear among Chinese people?  Most of the people on the "left" actually don't understand politics.  They just childishly want to rob the things they can't get.  All they care is to compare with richer people, but they don't really care about the so-called "down-trodden".  That's why they don't care when Muslims are killed.  In fact many Chinese people are very racist, perhaps even more so than whites.

And you may wonder, isn't it very foolish for Chinese people to be racist?

Yes.
