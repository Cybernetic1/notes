1. YouTube comments to views ratio = 0.5%
ie, per about every 200 views, one will comment.

2. YouTube users view a whopping 1 billion hours of video each day. That accounts for around 5 billion YouTube videos being watched each day. 

That means 5B views per day / 200 = 25M comments per day = 9.125B comments per year

The price for 1 terabyte (TB) per month of decentralized data storage ranges from $0.19 on Filecoin to $4.00 on Storj. On average, 1TB of decentralized data storage costs $2.11 per month in 2023.

This seems very affordable.
