Hello,
We are a startup company trying to build human-level artificial intelligence with international collaboration.
We are seeking students and researchers interested in this endeavor.
Our current AI architecture is based on combining deep learning, reinforcement learning, and symbolic logic.
In particular, we are currently looking for Tensorflow programmers familiar with Google's BERT model and reinforcement learning (eg. Actor-Critic).

May -- experiment with Google BERT language model
May to June -- combine BERT with reinforcement learning.
June to July -- feed our own data into modified BERT and observe its explaining power.
July to August -- make custom modifications so that BERT can extract knowledge from user data.  
August to September -- allow for more time to develop the AI system.  
September -- start using our custom system to build audience profiles, match profiles to advertisers
October -- evaluate performance of system over 1-month testing period
