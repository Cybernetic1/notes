Simply put:  a land tax may prohibit land-owners from making money without meaningful work, in accord with the principle of fair competition.

But if the land is not on auction, how can the government determine its value? and thus to determine the tax required?

Posner and Weyl 's solution is based on self-report:  the owner claims the value of the land, and pays tax accordingly.  However, if someone offers to buy, then he MUST sell it at that price.

This ideas may be awkward when the piece of property (not necessarily land, but including land) has emotional value to the owner.

=====================
簡單來說： 地稅 可以竭止 地主 透過壟斷資源 不勞而獲
這是 Henry George 的思想
符合資本主義的良性競爭原則
而且它可能合理地終止香港的地產霸權

問題是： 如果土地並不在拍賣中，則如果估計其地價？ 

Posner & Weyl 的方案是：自行報價，然後按價交稅。
但如果有人要買，則 *必需* 按價出售

但這樣有個問題，就是人們無法留住想要的資產，即使對它有感情上的價值
