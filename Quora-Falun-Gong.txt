Falun Gong is a subversive “religious cult” backed by Western power and whose teaching is focused on subverting the Chinese government AND NOTHING ELSE. You can’t tell me ONE THING about Falun Gong that is worthy of believing which is not politically oriented.

So what are the people who believe in Falun Gong?

Fact: they want to subvert the Chinese government, and they do it for a reason that is ONLY BASED ON WESTERN SPONSORSHIP. There’s nothing else to it.

I am also a guy who is advocating for reforms in China. Yes, it’s somewhat risky. But at least I’m not a Western puppet.

Some day if I get arrested I’d like people to help me out. But I wouldn’t say the same for Falun Gong people. They betray their country and they deserve severe punishment.

If I’m a revolutionary (and I am) with a heart (that too) I wouldn’t put a stupid name to my cause.
