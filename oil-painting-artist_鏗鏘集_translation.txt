"I choose to use abstract ways
it has some paradoxical content
it is the artist's view of society
which he cannot express directly"

[ Some of his creative ideas, such as religion,
are sensitive topics in the mainland,
that once caused him to be under surveillance.
He said there are many dissident voices in recent years
that the government censored under the rationale of stability
that greatly limited his space for creativity ]

"The government fears any of their evil deeds being uncovered
For instance, if the Chinese legal system is complete
then the government's power would not expand without bounds
If its power keeps expanding
then they can drown out all voices
I feel that ultimately we need legal reformation
When humans have achieved a certain level of material satisfaction
They will start thinking about such issues"

[ 40 years have passed, Zeng [the artist] says
the people's living standards have indeed improved
but political reforms have not taken a single step
In recent years the government even strengthened idiological control.
To create truly original Chinese art, there is still a long way to go ]

"You cannot speak out, if you speak out somebody will cause you trouble
Every day there'd be people surrounding and harassing you
A lot of troubles will ensue, for no reason at all
You may disappear for no reason
If you speak more strongly, they will keep you under surveillance
Then this becomes a very serious problem
The key problem is here, you understand?
It causes the people to forget quickly
That's the problem
And then the people can no longer bear being responsible to society
He cannot bear it
There is no way, how can he bear it?"

[ This year is the 40th year since China opened its economic policy
For someone like Le, who has labored half of his life as a worker
Facing the new economy transitioning once again
He could only follow the nation's footstep
with uncertainty ]
