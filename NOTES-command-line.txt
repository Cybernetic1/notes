**** Find and replace ****

Occurrences of "foo" will be replaced with "bar":
    sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' *

On BSD systems like macOS, you need to provide a backup extension like -i '.bak' or else "risk corruption or partial content" per the manpage.
    sed -i '.bak' 's/foo/bar/g' *

**** Terminal does not echo keystokes after 'kill':
    stty sane
