1. Progress is a relatively "gentle" thing
but revolution is violent and bloody
That's why revolutions usually don't lead to progress
The problem of backward countries
is the rigidifying of power
that runs in a habitual loop.
Along this trajectory,
we can't find an "entry point" to progress
Or perhaps there is always a tangent space for progress
in any small local neighborhood
but those trajectories are inevitably drawn into
the global attractor of backwardness.

2. Power is based on violence
but progress is gentle and moderate
It is even quite feminine
like Christianity
It sympathizes with the weak,
tolerates mistakes,
and promotes universal love.
Early Christianity struggled to survive under persecution
only to paradoxically become the Roman state religion
How did this happen?
The famous book by Edward Gibbon
"The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire" was once a best-seller
but I've read it briefly and still donâ€™t understand it.

3. From the perspective of a backward person
their political system is "reasonable"
but from the perspective of a progressive, it is "tyranny"
In the eyes of the regime, progressive idea is a crime
The question is how to let people see the advantages of progress
Tyranny usually falls into the trap of prohibiting free speech
But it is common sense to all humans,
Only those who are in the wrong are afraid of criticism from others.
Therefore, the spreading of progress is an inevitable process
from the modern perspective we can better understand its mechanism
