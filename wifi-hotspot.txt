# Latest success is with this line:
   nmcli device wifi hotspot ifname <wlp1s0> ssid <YKY-hot> password <XXX>

# There was something wrong with authentication because "no password" worked.
# The above line sets the authentication method by default, which works.
# But if authenticcation is set manually by nmcli, log in fails

# --------- older stuffs ------------
sudo apt install dnsmasq-base
sudo service network-manager restart
nmcli connection up WhiteStick <--- note the case

# **** Hostapd seems no longer needed
# sudo /etc/init.d/hostapd start
# /etc/default/hostapd
# /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

Diagnosis:

sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
wavemon -- check freq of freq of hotspot host

sudo iwconfig wlan0 freq 2.412G
iwlist freq
iwlist wlan0 s			(scan)
