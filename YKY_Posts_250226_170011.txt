 @dannyiu5027  首先我 5年前 仍然是反對民主的
當時我極力譴責那些示威者，
在 Facebook 上幾乎所有香港朋友都 unlike 咗我
但我現在已改為支持 民主、自由、平等 的價值。
我不知道如果再回到 2019 我會怎樣做
但反正時光是不會倒流的，只有向前看。
我現在接受了西方文化中所謂 human rights 的概念
我覺得一個國家最起碼的基礎要包括 言論、集會、遊行 的自由
但這些概念是中國古代沒有的，
中國仍然停留在西方「君主獨裁」的階段，非常落後
（話說回來，中國古代其實也有「樸素」的民主觀念，
只是沒有系統性的發展出任何思想或理論）
孫中山說：「中國革命的成功，不能只靠軍事武力，
而是有賴人民從思想上的改變。」
所以我不讚成在街上攻擊市民或警察
但我們需要爭取言論自由、集會遊行自由、
（這些其實已經寫了入中共憲法裡面，
但卻很弔詭地沒有落實執行，
因為中國只是模仿外國的表面）
如果這些條件嚴格執行，中國會慢慢走上進步之路。
而如果政權否定這些基本的人權和自由，則武力抗爭是合理的
但也不同於在街上打人。
最後還不得不補充一點：有些惡毒的分子會故意讓民主運動蒙上污名
但我們很難分辨究竟誰是幼稚衝動，誰是黑心歹毒
「日久見人心」，短時間是無法分辨的
要記著《聖經》裡 麥子和稗子（雜草）的比喻：
不要立即把麥子與稗子分開，要讓他們一齊長，
直到收割，否則麥子會和稗子一齊帶根拔出來。
外國有些人會幫中國得到民主，
但也有些人會故意破壞民主（但表面上是幫助）
因為中國的崛起意味着白人優越主義的沒落
此不可不察也
 @okok-io9zd  你所講嘅美國偽善我亦有認識到
一方面美國霸權在蹂躪其他國家
另方面受害國家的政權亦在欺壓自己人民
其實就是「以夷制夷」的結果
所以要打倒西方霸權或「新殖民主義」
就必需同時打倒本地的極權主義
它們其實是同一回事
這些極權政府包括：普京、習近平、金正恩、
伊朗的哈米尼、伊斯蘭恐怖組織、…… 都不是我們的盟友

Ayala Yoaz Hello Ms Yoaz ...I'm glad you speak up... you are correct to point out that Israel was attacked on Oct 7th 2024, but it would be like accusing the classmate in primary school about who crossed the line of the desk first.. it's not particularly enlightening and cannot resolve the conflict. The Judaic religion claims that Israel belongs to Jews but the Islamic religion invented 600 years after Christianity claims that Muhammad was the next and last prophet. Both originated from the same religious root. If they continue to contest on religion there will be no end to the conflict. 
The only way out of this is to separate the religious from the politics, build a secular, modern state that respects religious freedom and racial equality, and end racial segregation. I am not blaming Israel alone. Both Israeli Zionism and radical !slam are wrong. They are like enemies made for each other. Those I support are the Jews calling for Israel to stop genocide and the Muslims who are willing to accept secularism and modernization. Just like 1 condemn racism but 1 love people who respect each other, but many missed my point. 
最近觀測到一個問題：舉例來說，一個美國黑人 投票給 Trump，或者對 美國現時存在的 racism 不太感興趣。 另一個例子是：一個曾經支持香港黃絲革命的 KOL，移民到加拿大之後對民主運動失去興趣，反而在政治上極力支持加拿大的保守派，包括其對新移民不友好，以及支持以色列在 Gaza 的種族屠殺。 為什麼會有這種「反常」的人？ 無非是：他們已經「上岸」，例如生活在北美，這些社會對某些中產階級的有色人種基本上已經沒有 racism，所以他們享受着種族平等，但對其他被壓迫的人 落井下石，而且他們平時在公開身份的場合下不會承認自己 racist 或 vote for Trump，只有在身份隱蔽的時候才會做那些事。  這種現象一點也不奇怪也不新鮮，因為 racism 的策略從來就是破壞不同群體之間的 團結 (solidarity), 而那些受迫害的群體之中最常出現的現象就是 _互相出賣_。因為在權力的欺壓下，背叛的人可以得到很大的紅利。 舉一個很遠的例子：猶太人之所以被歐洲人嫌棄，是因為根據基督教，他們出賣了耶穌。

I recently observed: for example, a black American voted for Trump or was not very interested in the current racism in the United States. Another example: a KOL who once supported the pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong lost interest in the democratic movement after immigrating to Canada. Instead, she strongly supported Canada’s conservatives politically, including their unfriendly attitude towards new immigrants and support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Why are there such "abnormal" people? Well, they have "come ashore", for example, they live in North America, where there is basically no racism towards certain middle-class people of color, so they enjoy racial equality, but take advantage of other oppressed people when they are down, and they usually won't admit that they are racists or vote for Trump in public, and they will only do those things when their identities are hidden.  This phenomenon is not surprising or new, because the strategy of racism has always been to destroy the solidarity between different groups, and the most common phenomenon among the persecuted groups is to betray each other. Because under the oppression of power, those who betray can get huge bonuses. To give a very distant example: Jews were disliked by Europeans because, according to Christianity, they betrayed Jesus.

I think you completely got me wrong, what I'm talking about was assets, is the funding, which was the money you deducted from your payroll, your paycheck, as an individual, you know, each of the citizens who are in the system, when they had taxable income, either they're automatically deducted from their paycheck, or they're volunteering themselves to pay for the person of the social security, and part of the social security was eventually the health care plan. Different countries have a different name to call it, but those money, whichever holding by the government, collected from the public bureau, was eventually being considered as a means of assets. Being managed by the government, and those funding were being invested to the stock market or the treasury bonds and other forms of funds to generate more profits. To support the system running smoothly, and to ensure there are enough fundings to sustain the system. And once those money become...

investment. And eventually, part of the funding has to become a taxable income, regardless it was from the government investment or from the entities who were helping to invest, or the employees who were working for the institutes. I'm not talking about the hospital. And those are all taxable income. And eventually, it will go back to the system to reinsure the system running smoothly. And this is how the system works. I'm not talking about the government found the establishment of the hospital. And a matter of fact, even the government found the establishment of the hospital, it is not 100% run without any business involved. For instance, even the money was from the government. And once they have to purchase any of the equipment and the facility, and they have to pay for the property, which they bought. Once they paid for the property they bought, the book will register and deduct the funds from the initial funding, or from the funding, which they had generated from the public. And what really happened was,

The public, when they go to the hospital, is not for free. The public goes to the hospital, they have to pay for using the facilities and for their treatments and for the salary of their doctors. The doctors they are hiring, the nurses who are serving for the public, and then the volunteers, so on and so forth, security, whatever. And those employees, once they have a salary generated from their jobs, they also pay taxes. And that was how the tax system works. And for the hospital, just because they had received money from the patients, and remember not every single patient were in the health insurance systems, especially in the capitalism world, even in the so-called socialism world, such as China, not everybody has health insurance as well. So there are loads and loads of the private payments, which are not, which has nothing to do with the social security systems. And they paid hardcore money without any deductions from the public health insurance systems. And those money are non-deductible profits and incomes of the hospital. The income was partially paid.

deducted by the equipment and facilities and the salaries and utilities, which the hospital have to run, and the portion of margins become the revenue, and it must be taxed. So there is no way you say if this is a public hospital, it would eventually exemplify for a qualification that should not be taxed by the government or by the system. Because even if they're fully funded by the government, still they are generating incomes. So this is the whole issue, which I was trying to explain to you that it doesn't mean if it's publicly funded. I mean, if a public hospital fully funded or owned by the government should 100% be a tax-free entity, because they still have the possibility to generate revenues from the public.

I think a lot of things which you're passionate about was just a form of ideology associated with your frustrations. Because whichever the ideology that you believed in was not supported by any side of the system, regardless of capitalism or the so-called socialism, but the real problem that you have no way to fulfill your dream or to achieve your ideology was because you don't have enough of experiences to find out the real problem of the system. The reason I felt like this was because just for the issue you have raised about the public hospital shouldn't be taxed. It's already fully reflected that you have not had a full investigation of the system, and you don't know what was the real problem. What was the problem that exists within the system? What was the real problem within the system?

I mean, the real problem of the American health care system wasn't because the public hospital being taxed. It was because the whole system being privatized and monopolized by the gianted health insurance companies, private health insurance companies in the United States of America. Because regardless if it's a public form or the private form, there's no such thing called National Health Insurance Public Bureau. And the system has to buy insurance from the private entity. The 401k doesn't cover the public health expenses. And there are so many of the American citizens which are not even covered by the 401k. And that was a whole issue of the system. As for China, China is not yet fully, it's not every single system fully involved into the public health system. Because for people who are 55 above or 60 above, many of them had never paid for the health insurances. And even for people who are 70 or 80 above, the DEN system doesn't even tax money, doesn't even tax their income because their salary is very low.

age was way lower than the average public could imagine. Because in the 60s or 70s even to the 80s of last century, the average Chinese person, their mental income was only a few tens of RMB per month. Somewhere from 18 to 50 something, only the higher rank officials could exceed 100 RMB back then. And because that was a fully socialism system, nobody pays taxes, but the government promised them that the government would take care of them. The system was malfunctioning, and there was productivity, and there was wealth, there wasn't prosperity. Only if after the open door policy, and after 20 years of the practices, the government started to establish the tax systems and the public health insurance fundings and the retirement systems differently from the past. So what had happened is that they gradually increased the level of taxation from period to period, and they had to change the government.

of times of the health systems. But ever since the open door policy had established, many of the the peasantry workers who come into the cities and transformed from peasant to the skilled worker, they have never been covered by the systems. And many of them also have not yet paid taxes fully throughout their career. But now, many of them are towards the age of retirement, and they don't have social security even. And that becomes a social issue nowadays.

And considering the face **amount of populations in China**, regardless of how wealthy is the country, and the enormous amount of population towards aging society, it's gonna be huge issues. On top of that, China has not enough hospitals to cover the entire nation, regardless of a city or rural area. And there's no enough of human capitals to cover the area of a practice, such as doctors, nursing, clerks and staffs, and the supporting systems for the research and development of diseases, and even for the biotech developments, I mean, the pharmaceuticals. Because many of them, I think most of them, or rather the supporting sectors of the American pharmaceutical industry, because they pay much more money than the Chinese government and the private sectors of the Chinese institutions.

I think many of the things that you were saying, it was **just one sentence of a conclusion**, such as the Chinese are not progressive. They are kind of outdated on saying, what was the word, a lawholder, just because they are politically being limited. It's too rough to come out with a conclusion, and it just stops your research in depth in any of the field which we're interested in, because your stereotyping has already limited your creativity or critical thinking to think more and to dive in depth, to find out the problems, then come up with sufficient and effective critiques, and then find out the solutions. So far, for whichever you were talking about, I don't think you would be able to come up with any effective solutions within any industry sectors if you're discouraged, or if your initial activities are being held, or not being encouraged, or even being you know, quote-unquote punished, or whichever the way you felt like. No one would just come up with an idea and then get

guarantee a success of one's ideology, **you'll have to go through a lot of difficulties** and you probably met a lot of criticisms and you probably being even facing extraditions, but nothing would eventually and should have not prevent your innovation ideas or preventing your practices. You always can find a way. It's not just saying that, oh, you cannot do anything in China because of the system. I guarantee you even a country which offers your full freedoms allows you to do whatever you want. You still could be denounced by the bank to fund your ideology because they don't believe in the project would be profitable or you won't find people who will eventually side by side with you to develop something for a decade. People come, people go, right? And then you're probably going to face the public criticisms from all sides. Then it might come up one day that neither side of the public would not believe in.

You know many of the Chinese societies which I'm saying Chinese society is not referring to the the type of passport which you are holding or the region which you are living in or located what I'm talking about is the ethnicities of the Chinese population even including some minority groups who are living in China. So in general in general speaking is the the area of the greater China and including the overseas Cantonese societies, Hakka societies and even Taiwanese societies. What has happened within this group of people is that once people had even tiny a little bit of opinions press which are not liked or agreed by the counterpart then it would eventually be generalized that oh you're pro-China or you're anti-China or you whatever the disagreement an individual's disagreement would eventually be generalized become a public political issues and people start to play policies and start to ignore the true meaning behind the counterparts of talk. To my understanding is that

even the idea which I'd raised by your enemies, there are still lots of things you could learn from it. And you could find, it could also help you to find the true problem. What was the true problem was? But what I don't want to dig into is that, oh, see, that's a problem because you're a little pink, or see, that's a problem because you're anti-China. It's too simple, too naive to conclude like that and then stop thinking what was the expressions behind that. If people would eventually be willing to sit down and listen to the true hearts of what they're talking about, you will find that lots of the defense was associated with the fear, with the insecurity of your counterpart. I don't say it only happens on the little pinky, it also happened, and it's most likely frequently happened on those who are anti-China. Because once they had superiority positions and now it's a downfall, they couldn't accept it and they couldn't take the reality and become denial. But that doesn't help them to progress. See, it's the same as the last time I was on the stage, I was talking with you and all the other people who self-believe, self-identify as anti-China population. What had happened through the half of the decades already

I mean, half of the century already, ever since the 1980s, the open door policy had established China under the CCP had key progress and people advance and made them become the second largest economy on the planet and had developed a lot of innovative technology which can compete side by side with the United States of America. Even though there's a lot of things that they have to catch up, but already there was no way that the other nations could compete with China and even the U.S. had a fear on the type of development and the speed of the progress of the Chinese population and China as a country. But if you look at the anti-China community, whichever they have is the criticisms from the word of mouth, is the denial of the fact and the extremely racism speeches from their mouths and the provocative hatred towards the ordinary citizens of China. And the baseless acquisitions to individuals, but not the government. And they don't even know how to utilize themselves with technology advancement. They don't even know how to weaponize.

their resistance to effectively gain support from the general public of the Chinese to help them to achieve the goals. I give you an example, for instance, for the Umbrella Movement, and then after the, what was the movement called, I couldn't remember, but there's two movements in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kongers call it a revolution. That's fun. It doesn't matter, it's not a big deal of the name, but the core value of the actions that the Hong Kongers have done, especially younger folks. It's not an issue they are willing to express themselves with their protests.

But it is an issue. The nonsense, racism, and the kind of humiliating attitudes which the Hong Kongers towards the Chinese civilians. There's nothing whatsoever have to do with the Chinese citizens, even if the government initiations or the actions towards Hong Kongers was brutal, was not acceptable by the free world folks. But there's nothing to do with the Chinese citizens. It makes no sense that Hong Kongers think that they can discriminate the Chinese citizens, and they can build a hatred by divisive speeches and self-identified non-Chinese, and then physically or verbally attack the Chinese people and disrespect their human identities. There are so many things that the Hong Kong people have done. Indeed, it hurts the innocent Chinese people. I believe many of the propaganda saying that there's no one innocent if they don't go against their government. Yeah, so vice versa, if you look at the Americans, almost half of the...

the population had votes, Donald Trump and the other half of the citizens supported the Biden government. And regardless of which government it was, the American citizens silently supported the Gaza genocide. Did anybody treat the American citizens as the same as they treat the Chinese citizens as a Hong Konger? Absolutely not. And they believe that the American government or their system would accept any single actions that the Hong Konger has done and reason and give them the reason in doing so because the Hong Kongers are protecting the democracy and protecting their freedom of speech. But that's also an illusion. And it is called double standard.
But the fact is that the U.S. had never physically sent troops to Hong Kong to support Hong Kong, the Hong Kong independency. And they didn't support Hong Kong with sufficient facilities against the Chinese government. Instead, they included Hong Kong into the sanction list. They also sanctioned the Hong Kong government as well. But that doesn't help Hong Kong to rebuild, and it doesn't help the resistance forces of Hong Kong to take part in the parliament to make the free speech exist. The U.S. did not effectively support the Hong Kongers for the movement. But on the other hand, while Hong Kongers spread hatred to the Chinese citizens, they still pay for the supplies which the mainland China had provided to Hong Kongers, such as vegetables, food supplies, and water supplies. So what on earth to make the Hong Kong people to give the Chinese population a vision as a secondary self-crowned colonizer?

to discriminate the Chinese population. And those indeed partially was programmed also by the Chinese government to divide people as well. But most of the times, if the government keep continue lying it and spread rumors, and sooner or later the citizens would find it out. But why does the Chinese citizen believing that the Hong Konger hates the Chinese more and more was because even for the Chinese government propaganda, they provide the evidence which had recorded by the digital age and people see through their own eyes what had the Hong Kongers, the Yellow Ribbon guys, what are their attitudes towards the Chinese civilians. And even when we come to the clubhouse to talk, you see the rooms which you have been to, a couple of them, that way Mandarin speakers were gathered. I think they were the same guy. It's a Cantonese guy. He moved to Hong Kong, self-identified as a Hong Konger, and support the independency. Consequently, staying in the chat room, verbally abuse and attack all citizens, whoever he identifies as a Little Pink, me included.

Hong Kong or the US wasn't like this before They were way much better than China But now they were like China And many of the sectors are even worse than China So that's not sufficient to support the conclusion of being bad 他们不烂 他们是后来自己烂的 也就不怪负人家再去比了 And then the funny part was They wasn't like China And they criticized whatever the wrongdoing of China And now they're doing exactly the same thing that China has done And even worse You cannot prove and say you shouldn't be lying 不是我们在比烂 They gave us a knife or a sword to do so 是他们自己dismantled他们自己的system 不是我们在比烂

And you will never understand, so once upon a time, we people, many of us who had ever had OSCE experiences, we believed in the American democracy and freedom. And nowadays, we've been even hurt much more than you do. And we're so disappointed Americans end up like this, like the Chinese. We don't want them to be this way. And you know what happened is like, if we were, like I have mentioned before, the anti-China populations overseas, if they're still not capable to develop technologies to crack the systems that the Chinese government had built to take down the wall or to initiate the form of, I should put it this way, to fund the fourth wave scene to distract or disrupt the system running or to compete with their system. And the anti-China movement will never even have a chance to take down.

the Chinese government. Because the fact is, America is in decline. They would not be willing to help any of the nations, at least within four years of the Trump regime. And the Europeans, they would eventually have a lot of big deal to deal with within their continent. Then who will be able to help the rest of the world? Think about it. There's hardly even a chance, but still there is a hope that if you want to develop the technology or you want to build up the ideology systems, you have to put them in practice ASAP. It's not necessarily has to be in China. To change the world is not only change China. You could possibly change the rest of the world and then left China behind, and China would eventually have to catch up. But if you just curse or if you just keep criticizing China with your mouth, it won't change anything, and China would grow much faster. You see, the Americans had already been threatened by the form of development of the Chinese. Then the rest of the world should have to worry about it, but not just believe in the greatness of America or believe in the ideology of freedom and democracy. It doesn't help.
