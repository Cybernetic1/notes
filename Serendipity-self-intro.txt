Good morning, professors, it is my great honor to introduce myself. My name is Weili Jiang. I am 25 years old, from Baoshan, Yunnan province. My family has five members.  My parents are open-minded and good at listening to my ideas, so I am outgoing and easy to get along with. My undergraduate and master school is Kunming University of Science and Technology, where my undergraduate degree is in communication engineering, master's degree is in signal and information processing. During my master's degree, my main research work is focused on machine learning. Two papers were published:  one on dynamic dictionary segmentation, and one on adaptive stacking classification model. The master's study mainly builds on emotional text classification models. It uses the K-means++ algorithm for clustering and resampling as inputs to CNN-Bi-LSTM models, where it can solve the problem of difficult labeling and unbalanced categories of text data sets. During graduate school, I participated in constructing a urology database system and data analysis. With the deepening of my participation, I gradually determined interest points and came up with ideas for further study. By referring to the literature related to interest points and viewing the recent research of the team involved in the literature, I have determined the teacher that I want to choose, and I hope to follow the teacher to do further related research.  Outside of school, I participated in the mathematical modeling competition and won the second prize of the Huawei Cup. In my spare time, I like to read detective novels and travel.
This is the end of my introduction.  If I am fortunate to be admitted, I will do my best to realize my goal, thank you all professors.
