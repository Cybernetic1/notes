Chrome Input Tools
==================

look into directory:
	~/.config/chromium/Default/Extensions/mclkkofklkfljcocdinagocijmpgbhab/5.9.0.0_0

Modify "chext_driver.js":
	look for tag: "ita-ppe-hlt"
	change its color

The python script "extract-colors.py" turns out to be not useful for this purpose,
	but the script works for what it's intended to do.
