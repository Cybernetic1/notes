I first read Haruki Murakami in the early 1990’s when I was in college, and was hooked, myself not being much of a fiction reader before that.  Since then I have read a lot of novels from many authors from around the world, trying to find someone similar to him, wondering where did he plagiarized from or at least what influenced him.  I even studied literature for a couple years.  To this day he remained my favorite author.  I’d say his style is really unique and perhaps with some influence from Raymond Chandler, Kurt Vonnegut, …  and “absurd theater” such as Bertolt Brecht.  I stopped reading his later works so I don’t know that part.
He is unique in that he is not interested in “plot”, but he tries to convey some philosophical ideas through fragments, or “vignettes”.  A lot of other authors write stories like “he’s the bad guy, I’m the good guy, and therefore, you should marry me”, but there is nothing much deeper behind the plot 😆
