Trying not to jump to conclusions, but Hamas (or ISIS, or radical Islam in general) seems to be doing a huge disservice to Palestinian people.  Sometimes it looks like they are accomplice to genocide rather than fighting against genocide.  And their religious fundamentalism is oppressing women, progressives and intellectuals, which is also harmful to their society as a whole.
Even Israel itself seems to be a pawn of USA, to destabilize and control the Middle East for oil.
Let me ask a few extra questions:
1. Does Putin love the Russian people or oppress them?
2. Does Kim Jong Un love North Korean people or oppress them?
3. Does Xi Jinping love Chinese people or oppress them?  I am Chinese so I have some say in this.  I am among many Chinese people who feel oppressed under the current government.  We certainly represent a lot of Chinese people and we are likely to be the majority.
4. Does Khamenei and Iran’s theocracy love Iranian people or oppress them?  In Iran’s case, it is widely reported that USA in the 1950s sent CIA agents (Kermit Roosevelt) to orchestrate riots to depose the popularly supported Mohammad Mosaddegh who ended up in prison and later house arrest.  The theocracy of Khomenei got in power in his place.
5. There are numerous more examples, eg. in South America (Haiti, Chile, …), Africa, … etc.
This seems to be a common pattern.
