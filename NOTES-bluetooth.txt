I did working reverse tethering from MacBook Pro El Capitan to android mobile. Sharing the network Macbook Pro with Bluetooth PAN.

The trick is, to have android mobile rooted. First connect your mobile to any wifi, change advanced network options in mobile as Static IP, 192.168.2.1 router 192.168.2.1 DNS 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4.

With terminal emulator apk, enter: su dhcpcd bt-pan

Now you can close your wifi in mobile.

be sure you have bluetooth pan configured as "Use DHCP with manual address" option matching same IP and DNS your put in android.

Note; of course android paired with the macbook, and sharing network and sharing bluetooth options active.

All working very stable.
